## Installation

Start by setting up an environment (e.g. `marketing_env`) with PyMC. It may look something like the following:

```bash
mamba create -c conda-forge -n marketing_env python "pymc>=5"
mamba activate marketing_env
```

See the official [PyMC installation guide](https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/latest/installation.html) if more detail is needed.

Assuming you have an environment set up then install PyMC-Marketing with the following command. This will give you the latest version of the library from PyPI.

```bash
pip install pymc-marketing
```

Alternatively you can install from GitHub directly:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/pymc-labs/pymc-marketing.git
```

## Quickstart

Once you've installed the library (see above), you can get started. If you want to work in a jupyter lab notebook then remember to do the following:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
python -m ipykernel install --user --name marketing_env
```

### MMM Quickstart

```python
import pandas as pd
from pymc_marketing import mmm


data_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pymc-labs/pymc-marketing/main/datasets/mmm_example.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(data_url, parse_dates=['date_week'])

model = mmm.DelayedSaturatedMMM(
    data=data,
    target_column="y",
    date_column="date_week",
    channel_columns=["x1", "x2"],
    control_columns=[
        "event_1",
        "event_2",
        "t",
        "sin_order_1",
        "cos_order_1",
        "sin_order_2",
        "cos_order_2",
    ],
    adstock_max_lag=8,
)
```

Initiate fitting and get a visualization of some of the outputs with:

```python
model.fit()
model.plot_components_contributions();
```

See the Example notebooks section for examples of further types of plot you can get, as well as introspect the results of the fitting.

### CLV Quickstart

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from pymc_marketing import clv


data_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pymc-labs/pymc-marketing/main/datasets/clv_quickstart.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(data_url)

beta_geo_model = clv.BetaGeoModel(
    customer_id=data.index,
    frequency=data["frequency"],
    recency=data["recency"],
    T=data["T"],
)

beta_geo_model.fit()
```
Once fitted, we can use the model to predict the number of future purchases for known customers, the probability that they are still alive, and get various visualizations plotted. See the Examples section for more on this.
