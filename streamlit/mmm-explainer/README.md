# MMM Visualization App with Streamlit

## Overview

This Streamlit application is designed to provide a dynamic and interactive visualization of key Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) concepts, including adstock, saturation, and the use of Bayesian priors. It aims to help marketers, data scientists, and anyone interested in understanding MMM more deeply. Through this application, users can explore how different parameters affect adstock, saturation, and Bayesian priors.

## Features

- **Adstock Transformation Visualization**: Interactive charts that demonstrate how the adstock effect changes with different decay rates and lengths of advertising impact. Users can input their parameters to see how adstocked values are calculated over time.

- **Saturation Curve Exploration**: Interactive charts that demonstrate saturation curves, which represents the diminishing returns of marketing spend as it increases. Users can adjust parameters and choose from a variety of saturation transformations.

- **Bayesian Priors**: Interactive charts that demonstrate Bayesian prior distributions, designed to showcase the power of Bayesian methods in handling uncertainty and incorporating prior knowledge into MMM.

- **Customizable Parameters**: All sections of the app include options to customize parameters, allowing users to experiment with different scenarios and understand their impacts on MMM.
